# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in Java üìöüíª

This repository contains my implementations and solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms problems using Java. It's structured to explore fundamental DSA concepts, providing hands-on practice with common data structures and problem-solving techniques.

## Repository Structure & Covered Topics

The `src` directory is organized into packages, each focusing on a specific data structure:

* **`arrayList`**: Problems and implementations related to dynamic arrays.
    * `ArrayProblems.java`
* **`linkedList`**: Implementations and problems covering linked list operations.
    * `LL_Problems.java`
    * `Node.java`
    * `SinglyLinkedList.java`
* **`queue`**: Implementations and problems related to queue data structures.
    * `CircularQueueUsingLL.java`
    * `MyQueue.java`
    * `QueueProblems.java`
* **`stack`**: Implementations and problems related to stack data structures.
    * `MyStack.java`
    * `StackProblems.java`
    * `MinStack.java`
* **`set`**: Implementations and problems related to set data structures.
    * `SetProblems.java`

## How to Run the Code üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

To get started and run any of the Java files in this repository, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal or Git Bash and clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/rohit1829/DSA.git](https://github.com/rohit1829/DSA.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    Change your current directory to the cloned repository's root:
    ```bash
    cd DSA
    ```

3.  **Open in your IDE:**
    Import the entire `DSA` project into your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse). The IDE should recognize the project structure and set up the build paths.

4.  **Compile and Run:**
    * Navigate to the specific `.java` file you wish to execute within your IDE (e.g., `src/arrayList/ArrayProblems.java`).
    * Most problem files will contain a `public static void main(String[] args)` method.
    * You can then compile and run this file directly from within your IDE.

    Alternatively, using the **command line** (assuming you are in the `DSA/src` directory):
    ```bash
    # Example for ArrayProblems.java
    javac arrayList/ArrayProblems.java   # Compiles the Java source file
    java arrayList.ArrayProblems         # Runs the compiled Java class
    ```
    *(Note: When running from the command line, you need to be in the `src` directory and use dot notation for packages, e.g., `java arrayList.ArrayProblems`)*
